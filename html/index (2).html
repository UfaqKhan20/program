    <p><i>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed
        in a web browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
        languages such as JavaScript.</i></p>

    <h3><b>Development</b></h3>
    <p><i>n 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN
        researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext
        system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year,
        Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the
        project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many
        areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.[4]</i></p>
